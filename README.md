### Description:

You are set into the Middle Ages. The game is action-packed with a 2d birds-eye view. The objective is to eliminate every enemy on the map. When you approach the enemy, you are taken to the battle field. You will fight to the death. You will do this until you have completed dominated the map.

### Game Synopsis

Coded with the same concepts as my other game [Army](https://github.com/KevinThorne/armypygame) with tables of strings as layout builders. Although, I did start to play around a bit more with varying game mechanics, such as the main game play being done in a field, then the battle scenes after colliding with enemies on the field.


### Requirements:
